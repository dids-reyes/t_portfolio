As you will be labeled as weak? Remember that depression is not a sign of weakness, and seeking help is a sign of strength.</p>\n<p>Since the sudden spread of Covid-19 around the world affected our daily lives, the economy dropped and some are at risk of losing their livelihoods, most of the companies as well as small businesses closed in compliance with government regulation due to the pandemic and causes a drastic increase in the unemployment rate here in the Philippines.</p>\n<p>To provide a solution and resume students learning the <strong>Department of Education (DepEd)</strong> implemented online learning.</p>\n<p><strong>Why did DepEd implement it?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>According to DepEd\u2019s, it is an online platform for public school teachers to support distance learning modalities. It was designed as a direct solution to give access to online review materials and Open Educational Resources (OERs) during class suspensions and other similar circumstances. <a href=\"https://www.teacherph.com/deped-online-learning-smartphone-education/\">https://www.teacherph.com/deped-online-learning-smartphone-education/</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>Commission on Higher Education (CHED)</strong> also proposed new normal for tertiary level education.</p>\n<blockquote>The <strong>Chairman</strong> of the Commission of Higher Education Prospero de Vera III announced that flexible learning would be the new normal for tertiary level students. <a href=\"https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/05/24/news/national/flexible-learning-will-be-the-norm-ched/1800408\">https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/05/24/news/national/flexible-learning-will-be-the-norm-ched/1800408</a>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>But did it work? Do students actually learn while at\u00a0home?</h4>\n<p>Well, some learn and students do engage in online meetings, but the majority of the students based on my experience, there\u2019s no learning process that takes place, if you have a quiz or exams and if you\u2019re lucky enough to have a good internet connection, Google! Why bother to review if you can search it? Assignments? You just need a friend to copy homework make some changes and you\u2019re good to go. This doesn\u2019t apply to all students but sadly the majority of students know and experience this, how a student will be taught and learn would greatly depend on the teacher/professors assigned, the school you\u2019re currently in, and the student\u00a0itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s a scenario</strong>: You have a Teacher/Professor that is very strict when it comes to\u00a0exams.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*vsg_fesANJZvrs9J\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@chuklanov?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Avel Chuklanov</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>You need to open your camera and share your screen during exams so the proctor can monitor you, in some instances, you needed another camera with a different angle to make sure you\u2019re not cheating.</p>\n<p>Some can improvise it's their room so students can find a way to cheat, If not memorization will take\u00a0place.</p>\n<p>Memorization <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/check-mark/\">\u2714\ufe0f</a></p>\n<p>Learning <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/cross-mark/\">\u274c</a></p>\n<p>Studying did take place but in a way of memorizing terms and keywords for exams but the essence of learning I'm not sure if it did take place, do you remember your last exam? If so what did you learn about\u00a0it?</p>\n<p>Not only do Junior High, Seniors, and Tertiary Level students experience this, middle-grade students did too their attention span is too short for online meetings, without proper guidance, they often zone out. Learning On-Screen is not enough parents hire tutors or teach their kids personally to\u00a0learn.</p>\n<blockquote>DESPITE the challenges to the unprecedented shift to distance learning, the Department of Education (DepEd) said the class opening this school year has been a success. <a href=\"https://www.manilatimes.net/2020/10/30/news/top-stories/distance-learning-a-success-briones/788788\">https://www.manilatimes.net/2020/10/30/news/top-stories/distance-learning-a-success-briones/788788</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The \u201copening\u201d of the school year was indeed a success. But the learning process? I guess not. Because living in a third World Country, slow Internet Connection is the main problem for most students that can\u2019t afford high-speed data or network providers.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s either the students can\u2019t join online meetings because of network issues or the teacher/professor has a poor internet connection and causes lag or choppy voice while discussing lessons. These are just some of the reasons why students are unable to attend or pass some requirements online. From those small problems that the student experience it creates a small but constant fear of missing out, then Mental Illness exists, from a small problem it will grow eventually, \u2018cause first, not all can afford unlimited data a normal student will worry financially how he can keep up using Data Promos, Public School students are not financially stable and doesn\u2019t have the tech/gadgets used for online meetings that\u2019s why some choose to drop out and work part-time instead of finishing schools semester.</p>\n<p>Other hindrances are the environment of a student, not all have a private/personal space/own room, an inconsiderate teachers/professors require a clean background, open camera, and no noisy background, most students don\u2019t have the luxury to live in a private residence where you can\u2019t hear any roosters crows, dogs bark and any unnecessary background noise. This gives anxiety and makes the students less confident.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*YZyta-eL3K3Fm8Rg\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@eliottreyna?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Eliott Reyna</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>\n<strong>Using web cameras should be optional for online classes</strong> to protect the privacy of students, according to guidelines from school representatives part of the Data Privacy Council for the Education Sector. <a href=\"https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/9/16/online-learning-guidelines-data-privacy.html\">https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/9/16/online-learning-guidelines-data-privacy.html</a>\n</blockquote>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nFbNfFaNzLpZFUk6jWaIjA.jpeg\"><figcaption>Photo by <em>Jire Carreon via </em><a href=\"https://www.licas.news/2020/10/06/millions-of-filipino-children-go-online-as-classes-open-amid-pandemic/\">https://www.licas.news/2020/10/06/millions-of-filipino-children-go-online-as-classes-open-amid-pandemic/</a></figcaption></figure><h4>Maybe you\u2019re wondering why online classes are more mentally exhausting than physical?</h4>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to worry about waking up earlier to commute or go to school.

Mental Health matters most, a bachelor\u2019s degree, diploma or any other school achievement doesn\u2019t really matter if you neglected your mental health. <a href=\"http://psychologytoday.com/us/blog/when-your-adult-child-breaks-your-heart/201512/untreated-mental-illness\">Untreated Mental\u00a0Illness</a></p>\n<p>Always remember as Rudolph Steiner once said, <strong>\u201cEducation is a journey, not a race\u201d</strong> it doesn\u2019t matter how old are you or how slowly you go as long as you keep on going, and don\u2019t ever forget to take a step\u00a0back.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=fe30bcf702e4\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*XketaG6MBhof0FGS\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@thoughtcatalog?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Thought Catalog</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>Maybe you already know the answer, it\u2019s a big\u00a0Yes?</blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s a question in mind that keeps me awake all day. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s okay to stop for a year or two drops out and come back to school until the pandemic is over.\u201d But you're also constantly worrying about the future, and the time it would waste doing nothing while your peers/batchmates are currently studying online while you\u2019re isolating yourself, depressed, stressed, anxious, and trying to cope up with your mental\u00a0illness.</p>\n<p>Too afraid to voice out? As you will be labeled as weak? Remember that depression is not a sign of weakness, and seeking help is a sign of strength.</p>\n<p>Since the sudden spread of Covid-19 around the world affected our daily lives, the economy dropped and some are at risk of losing their livelihoods, most of the companies as well as small businesses closed in compliance with government regulation due to the pandemic and causes a drastic increase in the unemployment rate here in the Philippines.</p>\n<p>To provide a solution and resume students learning the <strong>Department of Education (DepEd)</strong> implemented online learning.</p>\n<p><strong>Why did DepEd implement it?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>According to DepEd\u2019s, it is an online platform for public school teachers to support distance learning modalities. It was designed as a direct solution to give access to online review materials and Open Educational Resources (OERs) during class suspensions and other similar circumstances. <a href=\"https://www.teacherph.com/deped-online-learning-smartphone-education/\">https://www.teacherph.com/deped-online-learning-smartphone-education/</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>Commission on Higher Education (CHED)</strong> also proposed new normal for tertiary level education.</p>\n<blockquote>The <strong>Chairman</strong> of the Commission of Higher Education Prospero de Vera III announced that flexible learning would be the new normal for tertiary level students. <a href=\"https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/05/24/news/national/flexible-learning-will-be-the-norm-ched/1800408\">https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/05/24/news/national/flexible-learning-will-be-the-norm-ched/1800408</a>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>But did it work? Do students actually learn while at\u00a0home?</h4>\n<p>Well, some learn and students do engage in online meetings, but the majority of the students based on my experience, there\u2019s no learning process that takes place, if you have a quiz or exams and if you\u2019re lucky enough to have a good internet connection, Google! Why bother to review if you can search it? Assignments? You just need a friend to copy homework make some changes and you\u2019re good to go. This doesn\u2019t apply to all students but sadly the majority of students know and experience this, how a student will be taught and learn would greatly depend on the teacher/professors assigned, the school you\u2019re currently in, and the student\u00a0itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s a scenario</strong>: You have a Teacher/Professor that is very strict when it comes to\u00a0exams.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*vsg_fesANJZvrs9J\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@chuklanov?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Avel Chuklanov</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>You need to open your camera and share your screen during exams so the proctor can monitor you, in some instances, you needed another camera with a different angle to make sure you\u2019re not cheating.</p>\n<p>Some can improvise it's their room so students can find a way to cheat, If not memorization will take\u00a0place.</p>\n<p>Memorization <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/check-mark/\">\u2714\ufe0f</a></p>\n<p>Learning <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/cross-mark/\">\u274c</a></p>\n<p>Studying did take place but in a way of memorizing terms and keywords for exams but the essence of learning I'm not sure if it did take place, do you remember your last exam? If so what did you learn about\u00a0it?</p>\n<p>Not only do Junior High, Seniors, and Tertiary Level students experience this, middle-grade students did too their attention span is too short for online meetings, without proper guidance, they often zone out. Learning On-Screen is not enough parents hire tutors or teach their kids personally to\u00a0learn.</p>\n<blockquote>DESPITE the challenges to the unprecedented shift to distance learning, the Department of Education (DepEd) said the class opening this school year has been a success. <a href=\"https://www.manilatimes.net/2020/10/30/news/top-stories/distance-learning-a-success-briones/788788\">https://www.manilatimes.net/2020/10/30/news/top-stories/distance-learning-a-success-briones/788788</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The \u201copening\u201d of the school year was indeed a success. But the learning process? I guess not. Because living in a third World Country, slow Internet Connection is the main problem for most students that can\u2019t afford high-speed data or network providers.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s either the students can\u2019t join online meetings because of network issues or the teacher/professor has a poor internet connection and causes lag or choppy voice while discussing lessons. These are just some of the reasons why students are unable to attend or pass some requirements online. From those small problems that the student experience it creates a small but constant fear of missing out, then Mental Illness exists, from a small problem it will grow eventually, \u2018cause first, not all can afford unlimited data a normal student will worry financially how he can keep up using Data Promos, Public School students are not financially stable and doesn\u2019t have the tech/gadgets used for online meetings that\u2019s why some choose to drop out and work part-time instead of finishing schools semester.</p>\n<p>Other hindrances are the environment of a student, not all have a private/personal space/own room, an inconsiderate teachers/professors require a clean background, open camera, and no noisy background, most students don\u2019t have the luxury to live in a private residence where you can\u2019t hear any roosters crows, dogs bark and any unnecessary background noise. This gives anxiety and makes the students less confident.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*YZyta-eL3K3Fm8Rg\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@eliottreyna?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Eliott Reyna</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>\n<strong>Using web cameras should be optional for online classes</strong> to protect the privacy of students, according to guidelines from school representatives part of the Data Privacy Council for the Education Sector. <a href=\"https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/9/16/online-learning-guidelines-data-privacy.html\">https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/9/16/online-learning-guidelines-data-privacy.html</a>\n</blockquote>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*nFbNfFaNzLpZFUk6jWaIjA.jpeg\"><figcaption>Photo by <em>Jire Carreon via </em><a href=\"https://www.licas.news/2020/10/06/millions-of-filipino-children-go-online-as-classes-open-amid-pandemic/\">https://www.licas.news/2020/10/06/millions-of-filipino-children-go-online-as-classes-open-amid-pandemic/</a></figcaption></figure><h4>Maybe you\u2019re wondering why online classes are more mentally exhausting than physical?</h4>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to worry about waking up earlier to commute or go to school.
